<h1>OWLDoc</h1>
<p>The first rewrite of the popular OWLDoc tool that now has both an export to
 HTML and a dynamic view that allows you to browse from within Protege.
 OWL1.1 is supported and full use is made of the highly optimised OWLAPI Usage model.
 All links navigate to the appropriate resource. Further features
 (including a server version with search/query support) are under development.</p>

<p>Find the OWLDoc View under the <b>View | Misc views</b> menu.
<br>An HTML presentation of the last selected class, property or individual will be
displayed as you browse. Updates to the ontology are reflected immediately.</p>

<p>OWLDoc export is in the <b>Tools</b> menu
<br>Provide a directory to export to and a browser will open when it finishes. OWLDoc
will create a bundle of (mostly) static HTML pages for publishing to the web or
distributing to colleagues (a small amount of Javascript is used to create a fragment
of the class hierarchy on each class summary page).</p>
