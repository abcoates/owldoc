<h2>OWLDoc</h2>
<p>The first rewrite of the popular OWLDoc tool that now has both an export to
 HTML and a dynamic view that allows you to browse from within Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.
 OWL1.1 is supported and full use is made of the highly optimised OWLAPI Usage model.
 All links navigate to the appropriate resource. Further features
 (including a server version with search/query support) are under development.

<p>Find the OWLDoc View under the <b>View | Misc views</b> menu.
<br>An HTML presentation of the last selected class, property or individual will be displayed as you browse.
Updates to the ontology are reflected immediately.

<p>OWLDoc export is in the <b>Tools</b> menu
<br>Provide a directory to export to and a browser will open when it finishes. OWLDoc will create a bundle of (mostly) static HTML pages for publishing to the web or distributing to colleagues (a small amount of javascript is used to create a fragment of the class hierarchy on each class summary page).
